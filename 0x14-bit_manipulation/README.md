## Bit Manipulation

Welcome to the Bit Manipulation Directory! This directory contains resources and code snippets related to bit manipulation, a fundamental technique in computer programming and digital circuit design.

#What is Bit Manipulation?

Bit manipulation refers to the process of manipulating individual bits within a binary sequence. In computer programming, bits are the smallest unit of data that can be manipulated, and are represented as a sequence of 0s and 1s. By manipulating individual bits, programmers can perform a variety of operations, such as setting, clearing, and toggling individual bits, as well as performing logical operations like AND, OR, and XOR.
