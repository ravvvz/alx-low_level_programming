## MALLOC & FREE

Malloc is a memory allocation function that is used to allocated memory dynamically from the heap for your code. It returns a pointer to a void which means it can initialized to any datatype that's a pointer. While free() is a function that receives a pointer argument of which memory was allocated on with malloc. It free the memory to avoid leakage and so another program can use it. Malloc returns a NULL when it fails.
