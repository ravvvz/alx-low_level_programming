## STATIC LIBRARIES

Static Libraries in C is an archive that concatenates object codes int one file that ends with a '.a' extension. These object code helps to make programming manageable when it becomes sophisticated. When we compile with an archived file containing object codes, the linker traverses all object codes looking for the symbols or functions it want to use. Sometime you can have so many object codes in your archive file and it could take take for your linker to find a particular symbol, this is where 'ranlib' helps us. 'ranlib' is one of the index commands among "ar -s" and others that allows our arcive to be indexed and to quickly locate a specific information (in this case symbols) with searching through the entire archive.
